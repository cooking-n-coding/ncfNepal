      <strong>The Leadership Training Department (LTD)</strong> was initiated in 2006 and officially established in 2007 as part of the National Church Fellowship Nepal (NCF Nepal). NCF Nepal is a member of the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) and a network of mostly indigenous church groups and independent churches. <br><br> 
  LTDâ€™s primary mission is to empower Nepali churches through training and developing rural pastors, lay leaders and women in the church leadership. The initiative arose from the need to address the gap between theological education mostly centered in the Capital that trained limited numbers of church leaders and the fast-growing Nepali churches. Many existing and potential pastors and lay leaders are unable to get trained at theological institutions because of their low educational background, family and ministry responsibilities and financial constraints. <br> <br>

  The short-term non formal training is cost effective and a larger number of leaders can be trained in a short time. Also, the modular mode of training helps the participants to learn while continuing their ministry responsibilities. Thus, LTD is able to bridge this challenge of Nepali churches to a large extent.  

  In addition to equipping leaders with biblical knowledge and practical skills, LTD emphasizes character development and spiritual growth. Our programs are designed to be accessible and relevant, ensuring that leaders from diverse backgrounds and regions can participate and benefit. Through ongoing mentorship, resource sharing, and a supportive network, we strive to nurture servant leaders who can positively impact their families, churches, and communities. 
  By fostering collaboration among churches and encouraging contextual leadership, LTD continues to play a vital role in strengthening the foundation of the Nepali Christian community and empowering the next generation of leaders.
