      <strong>The Leadership Training Department (LTD)</strong> We organized an awareness program on Child Rights for 230 secondary 
    school students from 4 different schools in Baireni, Dhading. This program helped them to know about child rights. LTD trained 50 women in 
    basic book keeping in the Women Self Help Group. This training equipped 
    them to keep their financial transactions in a proper way.

        <p class="review-text">Ranju Pariyar is from a poor Dalit family. Her family didn't support her study. Her father is an alcoholic and always quarrels with the family. LTD supports her study.  She said "I was going to drop out of school because of my family problems and was unable to purchase the school uniform and educational materials. One of my brothers near my
    house, Ram Kalikote, who is Christian, came to me 
    and I shared with him about the struggle in continuing my study. Then, LTD started supporting me by providing me with educational materials since grade 9. This support has helped me to continue 
    my study. I would like to express my thanks to NCFN "  
    LTD responded to the needs of poor and marginalized people when their 
    lives were affected by a massive fire Bardiya. We distributed relief materials including mattresses and blankets to 40 families. They were daily laborers, widows, and elderly people. We also distributed school uniforms 
    and educational materials to 50 children who were from poor and Dalit 
    families. All the relief 
    items were distributed 
    in coordination with the 
    local government. The 
    village chairman and 
    principals of the school 
    expressed their gratitude to the organization 
    for helping the vulnerable people and appreciated LTD's work.   </p>

      <strong>The Leadership Training Department (LTD)</strong> responded to the need of poor people when 
    their lives were badly hit by COVID-19. The relief 
    materials included food items, blankets, jackets, 
    tents, and nets. About 900 families from 10 different 
    parts of Nepal were the beneficiaries of this help. 
    They were daily wages workers, prisoners, physically 
    challenged, and old aged people. All these items 
    were distributed in coordination with the local government. All the village chairmen expressed their 
    gratitude to the organization for helping the vulnerable people and appreciated our work which was supposed to be the responsibility of the government.

        <p class="review-text">Kalchu Saud migrated 
    from the remote hills 
    of far west (Acham) to the 
    plain (Kanchanpur) of far 
    west Nepal 12 years ago 
    due to the Maoist insurgency. She lives in ailani land (government’s land) along 
    with 20 other families near the national park. Her son 
    and daughter-in-law are migrant workers in India and 
    she is left with their son. LTD/NCF Nepal provided fiber blankets to all the households of this village the 
    last Nov. In Nepal, old people die during the night in 
    the winter as they don’t have warm clothes to cover. 
    After receiving the blanket there was a big smile on 
    Kalchu’s face and she expressed her joy saying “until 
    now I used to spend the whole night awake in the 
    cold season, now I can have sound sleep.”  </p>
