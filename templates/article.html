      <strong>God’s</strong> leading has been always a theme in the 
  ministry of LTD of NCF Nepal. Early this 
  year in our staff meeting, we were meditating on 
  this theme the life of Joseph and Mary during the 
  early childhood life of Jesus. We could find out 
  God’s clear guidance and thus protection and 
  provision in their life as Joseph and Mary migrat
  ed to Egypt and back to Galilee. We were able to 
  easily relate the lessons to our ministry in LTD. 
  How do we know God’s leading in our ministry? 
  A couple of signs indicate God’s leading.  <br>
  Firstly, Jesus said that we would know the tree by its fruit. “Thus, 
  by their fruit, you will recognize them” (Matt 7:20). We hear the 
  stories of our former trainees and know how their ministry is 
  reconciling marriages, leading people to Christ, maturing believers, so now they are confident to share the Word of God in the 
  church and small groups, and more importantly, applying the 
  learning. <br>
  Secondly, we see integrity, diligence, joy, and commitment in the 
  life and ministry of the staff team. They have sacrificed more 
  than what LTD has provided. Supporting one another is being 
  practiced more and more. <br>
  Thirdly, God has provided the resources needed for the ministry 
  in a timely way. A new partner comes in at a time when a faithful 
  partner stops supporting the ministry. A ministry leader leaves 
  for higher study and another leader comes in at the right time. A 
  volunteer joins to write a training manual that was pending for 
  several years because of a lack of both human and financial re
  sources. <br>
  Fourthly, God’s wisdom in the crisis. Certainly, we also faced a 
  lot of challenges and difficult times. We sensed confidence and 
  promptness while we made tough and painful decisions. <br>
  The examples of God’s leading above are not prescriptive but 
  describe our experiences walking with Him. It helps to under
  stand the ministry and leadership in perspective. As you read this 
  newsletter my wish is that God may give you a perspective to 
  understand His loving guidance in your life and ministry. My 
  special thanks to all who have contributed towards LTD ministry 
  and my prayer is for the potential partners that God may give 
  you a desire to consider supporting the LTD ministry.

    <p class="blog-text text-justify">
      <strong>The context</strong> in which we do mission is 
  changing. The strategy that worked 20 
  years before no longer works. The common 
  tendency of doing ministry is to continue the 
  way we have been doing. Of course, LTD has 
  changed a lot in the last 17 years, particularly 
  after Covid-19. Our recent impact evaluation 
  clearly showed the need for change in order to 
  grow. We are prayerfully planning to develop a 
  strategic plan this year which we are committed 
  to follow. We are yearning for change. However, we see the chal
  lenges are overwhelming, and change is not easy. <br>  
  There is constant hostility growing against the Christians in Nepal 
  communities. An anti-Christian spirit is being created and promoted by a group of people. The recent updates (Aug 2023) by UNITED 
  STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM advocates that the constitution of Nepal doesn’t fully protect 
  Nepali Christians. The Nepal government has a lot of legal restrictions to stop the growth of Christianity. The impact of media 
  on the lives of people has been so influential that without the use of 
  these tools, the ministry is not going to be sustained. However, we 
  don’t have enough resources (human, financial, technical, and other resources) to fully utilize the media.  We also have internal challenges. There is unhealthy heavy competition between Christian 
  ministries. We claim to believe in partnership but too often fail to 
  practise it. Thus, our resources are scattered, failing to work together to make optimal use of them. <br> 
  I have mentioned only a handful of the challenges LTD is facing, 
  though there are many more like Goliath. We require change in 
  order to thrive. Although not easy, change is a sign of growth, and 
  we want to grow.  Sustainable change requires sacrifice, commitment, and passion, as well as information and skills. It requires the 
  development of a culture of change, a good team, and structure. 
  LTD is standing at the crossroads of change. LTD requires a strong 
  heart like David. LTD requires a strategy like what David used to 
  kill Goliath. LTD requires your constant prayer and all kinds of 
  support to bring change in Nepal and beyond.

    <p class="blog-text text-justify">
      <strong>Leadership Training Department (LTD)</strong> of 
  NCF Nepal completed its training impact 
  evaluation of 15 years of service in 2022. The figures show that it has equipped 729 men and 
  women for church leadership, 900 women for 
  women leadership, and 234 couples for family life 
  by the end of 2020. The figures also report that 80-90% of trained men and women are in active 
  ministry and some kind of leadership positions. <br>
  The qualitative research findings clearly demonstrate the former 
  trainees are continuing their ministries in their respective places, 
  substantially contributing to the growth of their churches. The 
  research shows that the top 3 strengths of LTD training are: offered-subjects, teachers, and management. Interestingly, both qualitative and quantitative research findings are consistent with qualitative findings, explaining the reasons. The former trainees reported 
  that they have experienced improvements in their spiritual life, 
  relationships, and ministry efficiency. They have also planted hundreds of new churches or small groups and strengthened the local 
  churches through discipleship.   <br>
  LTD continues to seek to strengthen young but fast-growing Nepali 
  churches through leadership development in rural and remote Nepal. We stick to the same mission: training pastors and lay leaders, 
  women, and families from rural Nepal. The current impact evaluation has provided us with some clear directions for the change in 
  our strategy and method. LTD is moving now to modular and 
  online trainings while continuing with a smaller number of residential training events. It is now reconnecting and further developing 
  with former trainees. In order to increase local resources for income, LTD is trying to tap resources from former trainees and their 
  sending churches. Nearly 30% of our trainees have indicated that 
  they are willing to support us financially.  <br> 
  The information above is just a glimpse of what God is doing in and 
  through the LTD ministry. God who called us to this ministry is 
  faithful. I Thessalonians 5:24 reads, “The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.” However, the context is different today and 
  through God’s Spirit and wisdom, we are developing a new strategy 
  for the next couple of years.
