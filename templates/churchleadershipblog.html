      <strong>The Leadership Training Department's (LTD)</strong> mission is to empower the local churches through leadership development. So, LTD offers church leadership training 
    through online, offline (residential), and modular modes. We 
    have trained 63 pastors and lay leaders from different local 
    churches through online, offline, and modular modes in the past 
    one year. The offline (residential) training is for two months and 
    runs in Butwal, 200 km west of Kathmandu.  
    LTD organized a 3-day Church Leadership Training Alumni 
    Conference in Butwal from 5-7 May 2024. 110 pastors and leaders 
    joined the conference. The theme of the conference was from 
    Philippians 1:5. The features of the conference were to celebrate 
    God’s work, refresh the spirit, and be ready for a hard time. Rev P. Charles Jo encouraged from the word of God. Church Leadership Trainings in modular mode is going on in 2 different small 
    towns of west Nepal with 55 church pastors and leaders.  
    LTD organized a 4-day Community Bible Study (CBS) training 
    for 33 church leaders mostly women leaders in Dec 2024. This 
    training was conducted in partnership with Community Bible 
    Study (CBS) and the local churches. It has helped the trainees to 
    conduct bible studies for those who come from an oral culture. </p>

        <p class="review-text">I  am Amar Singh Subarnakar from Nepalgung-12, Banke, a Jyoti Niwas AG church 
    member. I completed 3 months of Church 
    Leadership Training from LTD/NCFN online.  I 
    didn’t expect too much from this online training. But this is something that changed my 
    thinking, attitude, and behavior. The subjects 
    delivered are very important and relevant for 
    leadership development.  All teachers are well
    educated, experienced, and skillful.  This training helped me to grow in Christ through spiritual discipline. I daily spend 20 minutes reading the bible and 
    praying with God. Now, my lifestyle is different than before. Previously, I read the bible but didn’t understand. The bible study 
    method helped me to use different techniques and skills to understand the word of God.  </p>

        <p class="review-text">Ramsuraj from Uttar Pradesh, India, bordering Nepal, came to Christ after his 
  mother’s healing. After joining Assemblies of 
  God church in southern Nepal, he was sent 
  to 3 months of Church Leadership Training 
  in Butwal in Feb, 2022. Ramsuraj states, 
  “Different teachers and pastors taught different
  topics which helped me to know more 
  about God. I understood the importance of 
  God's word. I was an angry man, I said bad 
  words to others. But this training helped me 
  to know how to love others and forgive each other. I learned and got 
  skills on how to study the bible and preach God's word.” 
  Now, Ramsuraj is one of the leaders of a local church with 50-55 believers. He also went to a new place to preach the gospel and has started a small church and is committed to planting more churches.  
  LTD offers 3 months of church leadership training through online 
  and offline modes. We trained 27 church leaders through online 
  mode and 12 through offline mode in the Far East Nepal training station in the second half of 2022.    </p>
