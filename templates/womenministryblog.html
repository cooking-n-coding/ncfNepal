    online and modular mode and trained 71 leaders in the past one 
    year. The residential training was organized in Lalitpur, 
    Kathmandu and Butwal, the west while modular was organized 
    in a small town of west Nepal called Rajapur.   
    5 women's leadership seminars were organized in the remote 
    villages of Makwanpur, Sunsari, Baglung, Dhading, and Lamjung 
    where 537 women participated in these 2-day seminars in the 
    last year.  Also, former trainees were visited in the training areas 
    during the seminars.

        <p class="review-text">I  am Rina Shahi Thakuri from Ratomate
    15, Hetauda, one of the women leaders of 
    Pabitra Church. I completed a two month 
    women's leadership training through an 
    online mode run by LTD/NCFN. I came to 
    know about this training through my 
    pastor’s wife who has already completed the 
    training. I was looking for training so that I 
    can learn the word of God and grow in 
    Christian life. I couldn’t go to long-term 
    residential training because of the children 
    and household work. This online training was suitable for me. 
    This training helped me to grow in Christ and learn many topics. 
    The topics were very important and especially the biblical 
    preaching was good for me. Before this training, I used to preach 
    from the bible just reading the word and explaining what I know 
    but after the training it helped me to prepare and deliver the 
    sermon. I thank you LTD/NCFN for allowing me to join the 
    training. </p>

      <strong>The Leadership Training Department (LTD)</strong> hosted a South Asia Women Leadership 
  Summit 2022 in Kathmandu from 5-7 Nov 
  2022. 21 women participated from Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. Three women from the USA 
  facilitated the training on forming the ministry 
  vision. The training contained group work, role 
  play, Bible study, life map work, and presenting
  the ministry vision. It helped to make good 
  relationships within the Nepali, Indian, and 
  Bangladeshi women leaders and find a calling 
  from God in their own lives.   
  The training on leadership development was held on 9-10 Nov 2022 
  preaching methods stood out to me. Being a minister in the church, 
  I have to preach from the Bible and teach other believers. But I did 
  not know the methods and skills. This training is a blessing for me 
  personally, my family, and my church. I will pray and support LTD 
  by sending other women in training and promoting the training.”  
  LTD organized two residential women's leadership trainings in 
  Kathmandu and Butwal (west). The same program was organized 
  in Kathmandu. 39 women who had completed Women Leadership 
  Training (WLT) participated in the training. Most of them were pastors' wives and all of them were having some kind of leadership roles 
  in the church. They were trained in decision-making, conflict resolution, spending time with the Lord in silence, and leadership qualities. This training helped women to build their mentoring skills, 
  increase their leadership qualities, and learn from each other’s sharing.     </p>

        <p class="review-text">Our trainee Sunita shares her experience of WLT (Women Leadership 
  Training) through LTD:  
  “I am Sunita from Milestone
  AG Church, 
  Kathmandu. My husband is pastoring this church. I took two
  months online Women Leadership Training. 
  This training helped me to know myself and 
  God. and reassess my spiritual, family, and psychological lives. I always felt I can't do God's 
  work, I had a lot of fears.  But after the training, 
  I am personally blessed and have begun to experience change in my life. I thank the Lord and 
  LTD. This was my first training so everything 
  was new for me. Bible study methods and 
  online too. Altogether, 50 church women leaders were trained in 
  both online and offline modes in the second half of 2022. 
  One two-day women's leadership seminar was organized in Hetauda 
  (central Nepal) with 80 church women.</p>
