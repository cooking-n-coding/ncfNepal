  couples that have conflict  over financial issues. 
  They found the husband and wife have separate 
  bank accounts and are not letting their spouses 
  know. They had loans from financial institutions without discussing with their spouses. The husbands remained outside of home 
  most of the time and got busy with their gadgets after returning 
  home. Many wives wept over their husbands’ behavior. They taught about finance in marriage, communication and the biblical 
  basis for marriage and family.

        <p class="review-text">Abinash and Laxmi are from the hilly region of Western Rukum, a district with just 0.9% Christians in the total population.
  Abinash is a pastor, and his wife 
  Laxmi is an Elder and women's 
  leader in the Musikot Assembly of 
  God (AOG) church. They have 
  completed 3 different levels of Family Ministry since 2017. They have 
  been facilitating and organizing basic family training once or 
  twice a year in Western and Eastern Rukum in collaboration 
  with local churches. They have trained more than 1000 couples 
  in the past 7 years.  
  They are motivated by several reasons to facilitate and organize 
  the training. Firstly, it is a new teaching to the church. They 
  have felt the need for this kind of education in the church. Secondly, the impact it has had on participants’ family life. It has 
  reduced the conflict between husband and wife, with forgiveness and reconciliation in couples who have filed for divorce. It has also improved their own marriage and family life.  
  They faced some challenges in facilitating and organizing basic 
  family training. Some pastors/leaders are not participating in 
  the training. They think that they already know about family 
  life and have a lot of experience.  
  “I would like to thank LTD for allowing me to participate in the 
  Family Ministry training. It has strengthened our marriage and 
  enabled us to equip others in rural and remote areas of Nepal” 
  shares Abinash.    </p>
